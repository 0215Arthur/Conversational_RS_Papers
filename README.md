# Conversational_RS_Papers
 Conversational_Recommendation System research Papers (from top conf/journals).

 This repo mainly collects some papers on the Conversational Recommendation System research from the top conference (e.g. KDD, CIKM and AAAI) and journals.

 We will update the latest published papers from time to time...
